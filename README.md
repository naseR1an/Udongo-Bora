## 🌿 Udongo-Bora
Smart AI Platform for Sustainable Organic Farming

Udongo-Bora (Swahili for “Better Soil”) is a modular AI assistant that empowers farmers with tools to diagnose crop issues, understand certification requirements, and improve yields through organic methods. It integrates machine learning, natural language interaction, and decision logic to support accessible, eco-conscious farming.

## 🎯 SDG Alignment – Supporting UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger
This project directly contributes to SDG Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture:

-🌱 Boosting Yields: The low-yield diagnosis module helps farmers identify limiting factors and apply organic solutions to increase crop productivity.

-🦠 Disease Management: AI-powered detection enables early response to crop diseases, preserving harvests and reducing chemical use.

-📄 Organic Certification Guidance: Farmers receive region-specific certification advice, enhancing access to higher-value organic markets.

-💬 Conversational Assistance: Language-friendly support improves access to knowledge for rural and smallholder farmers.

Together, these features drive smarter, cleaner, and more inclusive agricultural development.

## 🛠 Features
✅ Crop Disease Classifier – AI module for image-based crop disease detection

✅ Certification Advisor – Interactive guide for local organic compliance steps

✅ Low-Yield Troubleshooter – Diagnostic system to assess causes and recommend improvements
