## 🌿 Udongo-Bora
Smart AI Platform for Sustainable Organic Farming

Udongo-Bora (Swahili for “Better Soil”) is a modular AI assistant that empowers farmers with tools to diagnose crop issues, understand certification requirements, and improve yields through organic methods. It integrates machine learning, natural language interaction, and decision logic to support accessible, eco-conscious farming.

## 🎯 SDG Alignment – Supporting UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger
This project directly contributes to SDG Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture:

-🌱 Boosting Yields: The low-yield diagnosis module helps farmers identify limiting factors and apply organic solutions to increase crop productivity.

-🦠 Disease Management: AI-powered detection enables early response to crop diseases, preserving harvests and reducing chemical use.

-📄 Organic Certification Guidance: Farmers receive region-specific certification advice, enhancing access to higher-value organic markets.

-💬 Conversational Assistance: Language-friendly support improves access to knowledge for rural and smallholder farmers.

Together, these features drive smarter, cleaner, and more inclusive agricultural development.

## 🛠 Features
✅ Crop Disease Classifier – AI module for image-based crop disease detection

✅ Certification Advisor – Interactive guide for local organic compliance steps

✅ Low-Yield Troubleshooter – Diagnostic system to assess causes and recommend improvements

✅ Chatbot Interface – Farming Q&A powered by LangChain and LLMs

## 🤖 Future Extensions 
This project has the potential for future extensions that can enhance the user experience and make the app more accessible to a wider audience. Some possible extensions are:

✅**Speech input:** Adding speech input can make it easier for farmers who are not comfortable typing on a keyboard. This extension can be achieved using libraries like SpeechRecognition and PyAudio.

✅**Multi-lingual support:** The app can be extended to support multiple languages, making it accessible to farmers who speak different languages. This can be achieved using language translation APIs like Google Translate or by training the model on multilingual data.

✅**Image recognition:** Adding image recognition can make it easier for farmers to identify pests and diseases in their crops. This extension can be achieved using libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow.

✅**Soil analysis:** Adding soil analysis can help farmers understand the nutrient composition of their soil and provide recommendations on fertilizers and other treatments. This extension can be achieved using soil testing kits or by partnering with soil testing labs.

✅**Weather forecasting:** Adding weather forecasting can help farmers plan their crop cultivation and irrigation activities. This extension can be achieved using weather APIs like OpenWeatherMap or by training the model on weather data.
